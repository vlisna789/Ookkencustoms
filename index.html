            <h4>Archangel Gabriel</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The Gabriel shoe is modeled after the documentation of Archangel Gabriel in both the Old and New testament. She was known as the Patron of Communications, and borrowed iconography from ancient deities of communication like Mercury and Hermes. She removes writers block, can traverse all planes of existence, and appears to some believers in dreams. This ability to navigate all worlds is represented in the shoe with bright gold, bold blue, and pale blue feathered wings.</p>

            <h4>Archangel Jophiel</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The Jophiel shoe was inspired by portrayals of Archangel Jophiel, who in other texts such as the Revelation of Moses, is sometimes referred to as Dina. Potrayals of Jophiel focus on his ability to aid in the absorption of information, dissolution of narrowmindedness, and the ability to see and appreciate Beauty. Jophiel can also inspire artistic and intellectual efforts. The Jophiel shoe identifies this by painting two faces on the shoes. One with eyes and mouth closed, one with eyes and mouth open. The closed face represents the creative process of artistry, in which creation comes from within the artist. The open face represents the critiquing process of artistry, in which the artist must observe and comment on their creation. This duality embodies Jophiel’s own multifaceted abilities and impact. </p>

            <h4>Archangel Chamuel</h4>
            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The Chamuel shoe is inspired by Archangel Chamuel, who was known in texts for his ability to perceive interconnectedness between all things, assist in building relationships, and also known as the "Angel of Love". The Chamuel shoe, likewise, demonstrates interconnectedness in the form of a rose bush. Flowers, painted on the sides as growing together, are representative of love and romance. The thorny stems represent strength in adversity. The silver stripe near the soul contemplates the reflective nature of Chamuel’s work, in which he asks you to think more carefully about your relationships.Chamuel and the Chamuel shoe indicate that love, both romantic and otherwise, can be seen in unexpected places. </p>

            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The Azrael shoe, inspired the popular Archangel Azrael, features embroidery work and a moody palette of black and shimmer. This is appropriate, seeing as Azrael was often known as the Angel of Death, guiding spirits and acclimating them to the afterlife. </p>

            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">Archangel Raphael, whose name means “God Heals,” was an archangel devoted to the process of physical and emotional healing. Raphael additionally presided over travelers. Accordingly, The Raphael shoe features motifs of waves (in a nod to the style of the Great Wave Off Kanagawa). Water was frequently used in the Bible to symbolize cleansing, protection, and healing. Travelers, too, were often represented by water.</p>

            <p class="text-black-50 mb-0">The Ariel shoe, inspired by portrayals of Archangel Ariel, features painted flowers and wildlife.
